# PROMISE IN JAVA

## Callback function
A "callback" is any function that is called by another function which takes the first function as a parameter.
A lot of the time, a "callback" is a function that is called when something happens. That something can be called
an "event" in programmer-speak.

## Closures
Closures are functions that have access to the variables that are present in their scope chain even if the outer function ceases to exist.
